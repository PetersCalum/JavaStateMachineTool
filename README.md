# JavaStateMachineTool
An old Java project done for my MSC; allows for drawing state diagrams, meant as a teaching tool

Example Diagram shows a pre-defined state diagram that allows the user to step through the different states of a book object, whereas State Machine Diagram allows for creating and saving (and exporting) java objects; it comes with a few example state diagrams (the JSON files)

WARNING: this project was originally written in 2018; it is entirely possible that it no longer runs on modern Java, as I believe it relied on JavaFX for its visual elements, and that was deprecated shortly afterwards.
